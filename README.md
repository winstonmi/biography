1. Mini Project 1 - Who Inspires You
​ Create a biography page for someone you find inspiring and host it on Github Pages. ​

Steps.

1.  You should create a repository on Github with a gh-pages branch (remember the name is important). Set the branch as the default. Clone the repository locally and you're ready to begin.    
2. Create 1 or more HTML pages to describe the Person who inspires you. Try to include some of the following tags:    
    a. header    
    b. nav    
    c. main
    d. article
    e. h1
    f. section
    g. h2
    h. p
    i. strong
    j. emphasis
    k. h3
    l. a
    m. aside
    n. footer
3. Link to an external style sheet and include a CSS reset file, so that all browser default formatting is removed. Now add styling for all of the elements you've created above.
4. Add some additional styles using class and id selectors to customize your page further.
​ This project can be as safe or ambitious as you like. Feel free to try different page layouts such as columns and grids. Try to create a stylesheet that you can reuse on future project.
